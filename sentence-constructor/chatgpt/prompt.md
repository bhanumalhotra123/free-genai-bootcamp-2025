- "Bears" → What is the word for "bear" in Japanese?
- "At the door" → Think of the word for "door" and the location particle.
- "Did you leave the garbage out?" → Consider the verb for "leave/put" and how to form the past tense in a question.

**Cheatsheet:**

| Word               | Japanese       | Type                         |
|--------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| bear              | 熊（くま）     | Noun                         |
| door              | ドア          | Noun                         |
| garbage           | ゴミ          | Noun                         |
| to be (location)  | いる          | Intransitive Ichidan Verb    |
| to leave          | 出す（だす）   | Transitive Godan Verb        |

**Sentence Structure:**
```
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
```

**Considerations:**
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.
- The first part is stating a location where something exists.
- The second part is asking about a past action.

**Possible Next Steps:**
- Attempt an answer.
- Ask for clues about location marking.
- Ask for clues about how to connect two sentences.
- Ask for clues about question formation.
- Ask for clues about verb conjugation.
